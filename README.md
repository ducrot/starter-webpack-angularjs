# starter-webpack-angularjs

A starter for a project with AngularJS (1.x), Bootstrap (4.x) and Font Awesome (4.x) powered by Webpack (3.x).

* Webpack configurations for development, production and test.
* ES6, and ES7 support with Babel.
* Add AngularJS DI with annotations (/* @ngInject */).
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Stylesheets with Autoprefixer and SASS (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Development server with live reload and HMR.
* Testing suite with Karma and Jasmine.


## Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.js` inside [`/src/app/app.js`](/src/app/app.js)

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ducrot/starter-webpack-angularjs.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with yarn
$ yarn install

# start the server
$ yarn start
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

What you need to run this app:

* `node` and `yarn`
* Ensure you're running Node (`v8.x.x`+) and yarn (`1.6.x`+)

### Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `yarn install` to install all dependencies

### Developing

After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

* `yarn start`

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and update with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). The application can be checked at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Testing

Have a look at [`tests.webpack.js`](src/tests.webpack.js) and [`src/app/components/home/home.controller.test.js`](src/app/components/home/home.controller.test.js).

* Run: `yarn test` or `yarn run test:live`

### Production

To build your application, run:

* `yarn build`

You can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!


## FAQ

#### Do I need to add script / link tags into index.html ?

No, Webpack will add all the needed Javascript bundles as script tags and all the CSS files as link tags. The advantage is that you don't need to modify the index.html every time you build your solution to update the hashes.

#### How to include external angular libraries ?

It's simple, just install the lib via yarn and import it in your code when you need it. Don't forget that you need to configure some external libs inside [`/src/app/app.js`](/src/app/app.js).
